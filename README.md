# Py Data Science Projects

Welcome to my Data Science project!

As a junior data scientist, I have worked on various projects that showcase my skills in Python programming, data analysis, and machine learning.

Each project demonstrates a different aspect of data science, such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and more.

These projects are documented in Jupyter notebooks, making it easy for you to follow along and understand my thought process.

Thank you for taking the time to review my work!
